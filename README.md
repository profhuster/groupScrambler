# GroupScramble
*Group Scrambler* is a jupyter notebook that make groups out of a class list. 
*Group Scrambler* mixes up the groups in such a way that the students' new 
groups do  not have any members from their last week's group. 
The algoritm for randomly assigning groups each week is that it scrambles 
the members *within* last week's group then distributes them into new 
groups.
